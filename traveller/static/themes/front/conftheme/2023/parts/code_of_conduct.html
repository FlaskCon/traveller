        <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

        <p>Last updated: 3rd Sep 2023</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>FlaskCon is a diverse community who maintains a reputation as a friendly, welcoming, inspiring and dynamic
            group. We’d like to keep it that way, which is why we ask all participants, speakers, organizers and
            sponsors
            (collectively: the attendees) to follow this code of conduct (CoC).</p>

        <p>If you have questions regarding this CoC, please see our CoC FAQ below or contact the FlaskCon CoC WG. Your
            questions will only be seen by the members of the CoC workgroup and treated confidentially.</p>

        <h2>Be nice to each other</h2>
        <p>We trust that attendees will treat each other in a way that reflects the widely held view that diversity and
            friendliness are strengths of our community to be celebrated and fostered.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, we believe attendees have a right to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>be treated with courtesy, dignity and respect;</li>

            <li>be free from any form of discrimination, victimization, harassment or bullying;</li>

            <li>enjoy an environment free from unwelcome behavior, inappropriate language and unsuitable imagery.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Be professional and don’t spam</h2>

        <p>We consider FlaskCon a great setting to showcase the work of the community and would like to encourage
            networking and business related discussions, as well as keep the conference presentations meaningful and
            interesting for everyone.</p>

        <p>We therefore:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>only allow company marketing or recruiting related activities at the conference in accordance with our
                sponsor agreements;
            </li>
            <li>request presentations - outside the official recruiting sessions - to focus on Python related topics,
                not on recruitment.
            </li>
            <li>The FlaskCon Sponsor WG will be happy to answer any questions related to marketing or recruiting
                activities.
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Solving problems</h2>
        <p>If problems covered by this code of conduct arise, please contact one of FlaskCon CoC contacts listed below
            or
            any other FlaskCon organizer directly and in private. Any complaint will remain confidential, be taken
            seriously, investigated, and dealt with appropriately.</p>

        <p>The FlaskCon organizers reserve the right to carry out any of the following actions relating to a
            complaint:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The person concerned may be told to stop/modify his/her behavior appropriately and a warning will be
                issued.
            </li>

            <li>The person concerned may be warned that enforcement action may be taken if the behavior continues.</li>

            <li>The person concerned may be asked to leave the venue immediately and/or may be prohibited from
                continuing to
                attend FlaskCon (without refund).
            </li>

            <li>The incident may be reported to the local authorities.</li>
        </ul>
