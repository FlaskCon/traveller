## Setup

Create venv named venv inside root folder

Activate it


Install requirements.txt

```bash
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may also want to install dev_requirements.txt

```bash
$ python -m pip install -r dev_requirements.txt
```

Create a db named traveller or whatever you want in your MySQL db

```bash
$ cd traveller
```

Create folder called instance and a file called config.py in it

```bash
$ mkdir instance #auto ignored by git
$ touch instance/config.py
```

In instance/config.py set the __SQLALCHEMY_URI__. For MySQL it will be like this (the file should contain only that):


```
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql+pymysql://root:root@localhost/traveller'
```
'mysql+pymysql://username:password@localhost/dbname'.
We are using MySQL but you can have a stab at a different db.

Create or edit traveller/config.json with the information needed for each environment.

for __development:__

```markdown
{
    "environment": "development",
    "admin_user": {
      "email": "admin@domain.com",
      "password": "pass"
    },
    "settings": {
      "APP_NAME": "Demo",
      "ACTIVE_FRONT_THEME": "blogus",
      "ACTIVE_BACK_THEME": "boogle",
      "CURRENCY": "MUR"
    }
}
```

and for __production:__

```markdown
{
    "environment": "production",
    "admin_user": {
      "email": "admin@domain.com",
      "password": "pass"
    },
    "settings": {
      "APP_NAME": "Demo",
      "ACTIVE_FRONT_THEME": "blogus",
      "ACTIVE_BACK_THEME": "boogle",
      "CURRENCY": "MUR"
    }
}
```

Now in traveller/traveller run:

```bash
$ python manage.py initialise
```

Then, to get development example data (make sure requirements in dev_requirements.txt are installed)

```bash
$ flask seed dev
```

Then

```bash
$ python manage.py rundebug
```

Migrations:


```bash
$ python manage.py db migrate
$ python manage.py db upgrade
```

## Setup Mail Dev Environment

We are using flask-mailman.

If you have Node.js, use the [maildev](https://github.com/maildev/maildev) package. Install it using

```bash
$ npm install -g maildev
```

Then serve it using

```bash
$ maildev
```

Dev configs for this setup are (already in config.py):

```python
class DevelopmentConfig(Config):
    """Configurations for development"""

    ENV = "development"
    DEBUG = True
    LOGIN_DISABLED = False
    # control email confirmation for user registration
    EMAIL_CONFIRMATION_DISABLED = False
    # flask-mailman configs
    MAIL_SERVER = 'localhost'
    MAIL_PORT = 1025
    MAIL_USE_TLS = False
    MAIL_USE_SSL = False
    MAIL_USERNAME = '' # os.environ.get("MAIL_USERNAME")
    MAIL_PASSWORD = '' # os.environ.get("MAIL_PASSWORD")
    MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER = 'ma@mail.com' # os.environ.get("MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER")
```
