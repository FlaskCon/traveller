# Traveller

## Setup

Create venv named venv inside root folder

Activate it

Install requirements.txt

```bash
$ python -m pip install -r requirements/reqs.txt
```

```text
Debug install (Linux only):

Run if install issues:
(cat requirements/reqs.txt; echo "") | grep "^[^#]" | xargs -L 1 pip install

May need to manually install an older version of Flask:
pip install Flask==2.2.2
```

We are using MySQL but you can have a stab at a different db.

Create a db named traveller or whatever you want in your MySQL db.

## Setting up the database with docker-compose

**Note:** You may need to change the docker-compose.yml file is you have changed the username or password
of `instance/config.py`

```yaml

Install docker and docker-compose

```bash
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo apt install docker-compose
```

Adjust permissions for docker

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

Start docker service

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

Ensure you are in the root directory of the project:

```text
traveller/ <- You are here
├── traveller/
│   requirements/
│   etc...
├── docker-compose.yml
```

Run docker-compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

You can navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to access phpmyadmin.

The default username and password are both `root`

The database can be accessed at `localhost:3306` providing you have not changed any defaults.


## Setting up MySQL Database on Linux (if this is your first time with using MySQL database )

- Start MySQL database

  ```bash
  $ systemctl start mysql
  ```

(or)

  ```bash
  $ service mysql start
  ```

- After starting MySQL database, login into the shell

  ```bash
  $ mysql
  ```

- Create a database

```mysql
  mysql >

CREATE DATABASE traveller;

```

- This will create the database in your local MySQL server, you can exit the Mysql shell and complete the remaining
  steps

## Continuing the installation

Change directory to the traveller folder

```bash
$ cd traveller
```

Create folder called instance and a file called config.py in it

```bash
$ mkdir instance #auto ignored by git
$ touch instance/config.py
```

In instance/config.py set the __SQLALCHEMY_URI__. For MySQL it will be like this (the file should contain only that):

```
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql+pymysql://root:root@localhost/traveller'
```

'mysql+pymysql://username:password@localhost/dbname'.

Create or edit traveller/config.json with the information needed for each environment.

for __development:__

```markdown
{
"environment": "development",
"admin_user": {
"email": "admin@domain.com",
"password": "pass"
},
"settings": {
"APP_NAME": "Demo",
"ACTIVE_FRONT_THEME": "blogus",
"ACTIVE_BACK_THEME": "boogle",
"CURRENCY": "MUR"
}
}
```

and for __production:__

```markdown
{
"environment": "production",
"admin_user": {
"email": "admin@domain.com",
"password": "pass"
},
"settings": {
"APP_NAME": "Demo",
"ACTIVE_FRONT_THEME": "blogus",
"ACTIVE_BACK_THEME": "boogle",
"CURRENCY": "MUR"
}
}
```

Now in traveller/traveller run:

```bash
$ python manage.py initialise
```

Then, to get development example data (make sure requirements in requirements/dev.txt are installed)

```bash
$ flask seed dev
```

Then

```bash
$ python manage.py rundebug
```

Migrations:

```bash
$ python manage.py db migrate
$ python manage.py db upgrade
```

More info can be found in the shopyo docs: [shopyo.readthedocs.io](https://shopyo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Setup Mail Dev Environment

We are using flask-mailman.

If you have Node.js, use the [maildev](https://github.com/maildev/maildev) package. Install it using

```bash
$ npm install -g maildev
```

Then serve it using

```bash
$ maildev
```

Dev configs for this setup are (already in config.py):

```python
class DevelopmentConfig(Config):
    """Configurations for development"""

    ENV = "development"
    DEBUG = True
    LOGIN_DISABLED = False
    # control email confirmation for user registration
    EMAIL_CONFIRMATION_DISABLED = False
    # flask-mailman configs
    MAIL_SERVER = 'localhost'
    MAIL_PORT = 1025
    MAIL_USE_TLS = False
    MAIL_USE_SSL = False
    MAIL_USERNAME = ''  # os.environ.get("MAIL_USERNAME")
    MAIL_PASSWORD = ''  # os.environ.get("MAIL_PASSWORD")
    MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER = 'ma@mail.com'  # os.environ.get("MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER")
```

Go to [http://127.0.0.1:1080](http://127.0.0.1:1080) where it serves it’s web interface by default. See mails arrive in
your inbox!
Particularly useful when registering!

## Running tests

Go to traveller/traveller

```bash
$ python -m pytest .
```

## Some functionalities of app

Go to: [http://127.0.0.1:5000/dashboard](http://127.0.0.1:5000/dashboard)

Login with __username: admin@domain.com__ and __password: pass__

Click on admin and create a new role called reviewer

Add new people and assign them the roles

Go to dashboard and click on conf

Create a new conf

Add reviewers to conf

Go to: [http://127.0.0.1:5000/y/2021/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/y/2021/)

We'll db seed some folks soon
